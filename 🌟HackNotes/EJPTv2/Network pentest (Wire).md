1. Network attacks
	- Service related
	- MiTM attack
2. Packet analysis
3. Labs

Network Services:
- ARP
- DHCP
- SMB
- FTP
- Telnet
- SSH etc

MIM attacks:
- intercept traffic between 2 victims
- In the past, phy connection to the hub allows to view all traffic
- Now, switched dont allow that (smarterish) so, Common attack:
	- Connect to a SPAN port which listens too all traffic on a switch
	- ARP poisoning
		- Send out ARP req to say that attacker is a certain ip
		- All traffic for that ip is sent to the attacker (packets are bound to an ip addr)
	- Promiscuous mode --> listen to all traffic

### Configuring wireshark
pcaps --> readable and savable files to see network traffic
b4 capturing traffic choose the right eth

add coloumn by right clicking the column...add for more data eg source port/dest port etc

Right click on indiv reqs and follow TCP/HTTP streams etc to view the full req


### Tshark
`tshark -v`
`tshark -r filename.pcap`  --> spits out all the data (must filter/grep this data )
`tshark -r filename.pcap -z io,phs -q`  --> spits out hierachy of data (how many of each tpye of data)

filtering tshark data
`tshark -r filename.pcap -Y 'http' | more` --> spits all http data

data sent between 2 hosts addr
`tshark -r filename.pcap -Y 'ip.src==192.168.252.128 && ip.dst==52.32.74.91 ' | more`

All the http get reqs
`tshark -r filename.pcap -Y 'http.request.method==GET' | more`

Set specific fields (here: Time | ip source | full url of http req)
`tshark -r filename.pcap -Y 'http.request.method==GET' -Tfields -e frame.time -e ip.src -e http.request.full_uri | more`

Look for a real expression inside packets (eg password)
`tshark -r filename.pcap -Y 'http contains password' | more`
