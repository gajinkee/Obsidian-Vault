## System/Host-based attacks
#Systemattacks #hostbasedattacks

- Looking at exploiting the system itself (Windows/Linux)
- Usually done after a network exploit (after gaining access to the network)
- Attacks are focused on exploiting inherent vulns in misconfigured OS 
- Useful when attacking a host (eg some random employee latop connected to the server which you prev accessed using a network attack)
- The host might not be running anyt except SMB (or other stuff natively built into windows ) to file share with the server, so understanding of windows is necessary
- impt for exploits where hosts do not have typical public-facing services running (HTTP/HTTPS etc)

Outline:
- Windows/Linux
	- Overview of vulns
	- Exploit these vulns
	- Priveledge escalation 
		- kernal exploitation/impersonation
	- File system vulns
	- Credential dumping
	- Lateral movement 
		- Use of credentials found to move between targets
